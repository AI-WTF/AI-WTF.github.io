I’m a self-taught AI enthusiast with a passion for algorithmic design and creative LLM workflows. This space is a humble corner of the internet where I explore, learn, and contribute—no formal papers or jargon, just straightforward experimentation.

Current Projects

	•	AI-Integrated Document Parsing Library
	•	LLM Query Optimization & Intelligent Routing through more "rigorous" mathematical modeling
	•	Graph-Based Retrieval Systems (Graph RAG)

Vision

My long-term goal is to establish an applied research lab that brings together diverse minds to transform complex knowledge into practical products and services. While AI holds immense potential, it’s still maturing, and the next frontier lies in educating users about its strengths and limitations. Success in mission-critical environments like healthcare, finance, government, and legal sectors demands systems that balance usability with complexity, ensuring reliability and predictability.

This space is where I experiment with these ideas. Thanks for stopping by—stay tuned for updates!
